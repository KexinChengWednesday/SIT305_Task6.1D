# Task 6.1 - Personalized Learning Experience App

This Android application was developed for the SIT305 Task 6.1 assessment. It aims to provide personalized learning experiences for students and intelligent tutoring feedback using a simulated integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and backend APIs.

---

## 📱 Overview

The **Personalized Learning Experience App** offers a simplified prototype of an intelligent learning platform that:

- Personalizes tasks based on student interest
- Simulates LLM-generated feedback after quiz submission
- Demonstrates adaptive UI for multiple users
- Uses dummy data to simulate backend behavior

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Login Screen**: Greets the user personally (e.g., “Hello, Alice”)
- **Interest Selection**: Students choose from a wide range of topics
- **Task Screen**: Shows learning tasks with multiple-choice and short-answer questions
- **Smart Feedback**: Simulated feedback powered by LLM-like dummy responses
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on initial interest selection
- **Modern UI**: Blue-themed, accessible, responsive layout with improved touch targets

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Java & Android Studio**
- **XML-based UI layouts**
- **Simulated LLM responses using dummy data**
- **Backend-ready structure (API placeholders ready)**

---

## 🧪 Dummy Data

As specified in the assessment, the app uses **dummy questions and responses** to mimic real interactions. No real AI model or grading algorithm is implemented.

---


## 🧾 Notes

- Backend code integration is simulated; no real API calls.
- Touch target issues have been resolved for all `EditText` elements.
- Adaptive assessment logic is mocked with placeholder logic.
